"Enrollment-weighted tuition values represent the price charged by each institution weighted by the number of full-time undergraduate students enrolled in fall 2021. Public four-year in-state charges are weighted by total fall 2021 full-time undergraduate enrollment in each institution, including both in-state students and out-of-state students. Out-of-state tuition and fees are computed by adding the average in-state price to the out-of-state premium weighted by the number of full-time out-of-state undergraduate students enrolled at each institution. Housing and Food charges for 2022-23 and 2023-24 are calculated by applying the average one-year percent change among institutions that reported data in both years to the previous year’s sector average. In Trends in College Pricing 2019 and earlier editions, Housing and Food charges were weighted by the number of undergraduate students residing on campus for four-year institutions and by the number of commuter students for public two-year institutions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
